## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains a collection of Python files and subfolders that serve various purposes. The "actions" folder contains files that define specific actions and utilities for automation tasks. The "models" folder contains code files related to a project, defining data models and handling workflow execution. The "services" folder contains files that provide services for managing actions, interacting with APIs, and executing workflows. The "workflows" folder contains scripts and YAML files for loading and collecting workflows. The other files in the folder configure logging, define entry points for GitHub Actions workflows, and provide default settings and trigger configurations. Overall, this folder supports automation, integration, and management of various tasks and processes.

### `actions`

This folder contains a collection of Python files and a subdirectory. The files define various actions and utilities for automation tasks. Each file represents a specific action, such as running a bash command, publishing a comment on a GitHub issue, committing and pushing changes to a remote repository, crawling a folder, inserting content into a string, generating prompts using the OpenAI API, reading the contents of a file, setting the title of an issue, and writing content into a file. The subdirectory contains a file that defines a prompt context model for auto PR generation. These files can be used individually or integrated into larger systems or workflows to automate specific tasks.


### `gh_actions_entrypoint.py`

📝 This file is the entry point for a GitHub Actions workflow.
🔧 It imports necessary modules and defines classes for the workflow.
🚀 The purpose of this file is to configure and run the main service for GitHub Actions.
⚙️ It sets up the necessary settings, platform service, and publish service for the workflow.
🔑 It retrieves the required GitHub token and event information from environment variables.
📂 The file also includes functions to get the repository path and load the event data.
🔍 The event data is parsed and returned as an EventUnion object.
📝 The file logs the start of the workflow and runs the main service using asyncio.



### `log_config.py`

📝 This file configures logging and sets up a logger for use in the module.


### `main.py`

📝 This file contains the implementation of the `MainService` class and the `Settings` class. 
🔧 The `MainService` class is the main entry point for running the autopr workflow. 
🔀 It initializes various services such as the `PlatformService`, `PublishService`, `CommitService`, and `ActionService`. 
⚙️ It also handles the creation of branch names, triggering events, and running workflows. 
🔧 The `Settings` class provides default values for various configuration options.


### `models`

This folder contains Python code files related to a project. The files define data models for messages, threads, issues, and pull requests, as well as handle workflow execution and context manipulation. There are also models for different types of events that can trigger automated actions. Overall, this folder provides a foundation for working with messages, threads, issues, and pull requests, as well as managing workflows in an automation system.


### `services`

This folder contains a collection of Python files that serve various purposes. Some files provide services for managing and running actions, caching data, handling commits and branches in a Git repository, getting and applying diffs, interacting with a platform's API (specifically GitHub), publishing updates to pull request descriptions, and managing and executing workflows. There are also utility functions for formatting and truncating nested Python objects. Overall, the folder contains code that supports automation, integration, and management of various tasks and processes.


### `triggers.py`

📄 This file defines a function called `get_all_triggers`.  
📁 The function takes two parameters: `config_dir` and `repo_path`.  
🔍 It searches for trigger configuration files in the specified directory and subdirectories.  
🔧 The trigger files can have either a `.yaml` or `.yml` extension.  
🔐 It loads the contents of each trigger file using the `yaml` library.  
🔁 If the file is empty or cannot be parsed, it is skipped.  
📝 The contents of valid trigger files are converted into a list of `TopLevelTriggerConfig` objects.  
🔀 The function returns a list of all triggers extracted from the trigger files.  
📌 The purpose of this file is to provide a convenient way to retrieve and process trigger configurations.


### `workflows`

This folder contains Python scripts and YAML files for loading and collecting workflows. The `__init__.py` file defines functions for loading workflows from YAML files in a folder and its subfolders, and the `get_all_workflows` function is the entry point. The `autogenerate_readmes.yaml` file contains workflows for summarizing files and folders in a directory and generating README summaries. The `insert_into_readme.yaml` file defines a task for inserting content into a file with optional tag-based delimiters. The `summarize_pr.yaml` file defines a workflow for summarizing changes in a pull request.
