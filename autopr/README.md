This folder contains a collection of Python files that implement various actions for an autonomous agent system. These actions include tasks such as running bash commands, generating choices, publishing comments on GitHub issues, committing and pushing changes to a remote repository, searching for specific keywords in files, inserting content into text, listing files and subfolders in a directory, making API calls, generating prompts, publishing or updating issues on a platform, reading file contents, setting issue titles, and writing content into files. The files are organized into modules and classes, with each file serving a specific purpose related to the overall functionality of the autonomous agent system.  


### [`gh_actions_entrypoint.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/1595b4c1b1ad54f2c8501d83388e6b3d77ea6e12/./autopr/gh_actions_entrypoint.py)

📄 This file is the entry point for a GitHub Actions workflow.   
🔧 It contains the main logic for running the workflow.  
🔒 It retrieves settings and authentication tokens from environment variables.  
📥 It loads and parses the event data from a JSON file.  
🚀 It initializes and runs the main service for the GitHub Actions workflow.  
📝 It uses classes and methods from the "autopr" module to handle the workflow.  
⚙️ The purpose of this file is to orchestrate the execution of the workflow.  
🔗 It connects different services, such as the platform service and the publish service.  
🔄 It interacts with the GitHub API to perform actions on the repository.  
🔒 The GitHub token is used for authentication and authorization.  


### [`log_config.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/1595b4c1b1ad54f2c8501d83388e6b3d77ea6e12/./autopr/log_config.py)

📝 This file is used to configure logging settings and create loggers.   
🔧 It imports the necessary modules for logging and structlog.   
🔒 The logging level is set to DEBUG.   
🎨 If the "pretty" flag is True, additional processors are added for log level, exception info, and console rendering with colors.   
🔧 Otherwise, no processors are added.   
🔧 The structlog is configured with the chosen processors and the logger is cached on first use.   
📝 The file also includes a function to get a logger instance.   
🔧 The configure_logging function is called to configure logging on module import.  


### [`main.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/1595b4c1b1ad54f2c8501d83388e6b3d77ea6e12/./autopr/main.py)

📋 This file contains the implementation of the `MainService` class, which serves as the main entry point for the application.   
🔧 It initializes various services and handles the execution of triggers and workflows.  
📦 It also defines the `Settings` class for storing configuration settings.  
🔍 The `MainService` class retrieves repository information, creates necessary services, and runs triggers based on events.  
✨ Triggers are defined in the `triggers` module, and workflows are defined in the `workflows` module.  
🚀 The `run` method of the `MainService` class triggers the event and executes the associated workflows.  
🌐 The platform-specific functionality is encapsulated in the `PlatformService` class.  
💻 The `ActionService` class handles actions to be performed based on triggers.  
📝 The `CommitService` class manages commits to the repository.  
🔗 The `TriggerService` class handles the interaction between triggers, workflows, and the commit service.  


### [`models/`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/1595b4c1b1ad54f2c8501d83388e6b3d77ea6e12/./autopr/models)

This folder contains Python code and configuration files for a framework that manages and executes workflows in a Python application. The code defines data models for messages, threads, issues, and pull requests, as well as classes for handling events and context variables. There are also files for defining and triggering workflows, transforming variables, and handling parameters within a context. The folder provides a flexible and extensible system for managing and executing workflows with customizable actions and context variables.  


### [`services/`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/1595b4c1b1ad54f2c8501d83388e6b3d77ea6e12/./autopr/services)

This folder contains various Python files that provide different services for managing and running actions in an automated pull request (PR) workflow. These services include the `ActionService` for managing and executing actions, the `CacheService` for caching key-value pairs, the `CommitService` for creating branches and committing changes to a Git repository, the `DiffService` for getting and applying diffs, the `PlatformService` for interacting with the GitHub platform, the `PublishService` for publishing updates to a PR description, the `TriggerService` for handling triggers for events in a workflow system, and the `WorkflowService` for executing workflows and actions. There are also some utility functions for formatting and truncating data.  


### [`triggers.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/1595b4c1b1ad54f2c8501d83388e6b3d77ea6e12/./autopr/triggers.py)

📄 This file defines a function called `get_all_triggers`.  
📂 It imports necessary modules and classes.  
💡 The purpose of this function is to retrieve all trigger configurations from specified files.  
🗂️ It searches for trigger configurations in a given directory.  
🔍 The function looks for trigger configurations in both YAML and YML file formats.  
📝 It reads the contents of the trigger configuration files.  
🧪 The function validates and parses the trigger configurations using Pydantic.  
🔀 It extracts the triggers from the parsed configurations.  
🔄 The function returns a list of all triggers found in the trigger configuration files.  
📥 The function takes optional parameters for the configuration directory and repository path.  


### [`workflows/`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/1595b4c1b1ad54f2c8501d83388e6b3d77ea6e12/./autopr/workflows)

This folder contains a collection of files related to workflow configurations. The `__init__.py` script is used to collect and load workflow configurations from YAML files. It can recursively search for YAML files in a specified folder and its subfolders, handle exceptions, and log errors. The other YAML files define different workflows, such as making API calls, generating README summaries, inserting content into files, updating TODO issues, and summarizing pull requests. These workflows define specific steps and inputs to perform various tasks related to code management and documentation.
