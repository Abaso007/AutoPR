## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains Python code files that define models, actions, and configurations for a workflow automation system. It includes files for handling extra fields in models, defining triggers and workflows, transforming between different representations of IO types, and declaring variables and parameters. The purpose of these files is to provide a structured and type-safe way to define and configure workflows and triggers, handle transformations between different types, and render and evaluate values within a given context.


### [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/tree/main/./autopr/models/config/__init__.py/)

This file is empty.


### [`common.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/tree/main/./autopr/models/config/common.py/)

📄 This file contains Python code
🔒 It defines a class named "StrictModel" which inherits from pydantic.BaseModel
🔒 The "StrictModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for forbidding extra fields in the model
🔒 The "StrictModel" class also has a configuration setting "smart_union" which enables smart coercion of values in union types
🔒 There is another class named "ExtraModel" which also inherits from pydantic.BaseModel
🔒 The "ExtraModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for allowing extra fields in the model
💡 The purpose of this file is to define two base model classes with different configuration settings for handling extra fields


### [`elements.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/tree/main/./autopr/models/config/elements.py/)

📜 This file contains Python code for defining models and actions related to workflow execution and context manipulation.


### [`entrypoints.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/tree/main/./autopr/models/config/entrypoints.py/)

📝 This file defines various models and functions related to workflow configurations and triggers for a workflow automation system.
🚀 It includes models for workflow invocations, triggers (such as labels, comments, pushes, and cron schedules), and executable actions.
🔧 The file also contains functions to dynamically build workflow models and retrieve all executable IDs.
📋 The `build_workflows()` function dynamically creates workflow models based on currently defined workflows.
📌 The `get_all_executable_ids()` function retrieves all executable IDs from actions and workflows.
📄 The file defines various trigger models, such as `LabelTrigger`, `CommentTrigger`, `PushTrigger`, and `CronTrigger`, which extend the `TriggerModel` base model.
🔗 The `TriggerModel` base model defines common properties and methods for triggers, such as the ability to get the context for a specific event.
📑 The file also includes models for strict workflow definitions and top-level trigger configurations.
💡 The purpose of this file is to provide a structured and type-safe way to define and configure workflows and triggers for the workflow automation system.


### [`transform.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/tree/main/./autopr/models/config/transform.py/)

📄 This file contains code for transforming between config and action variables.
🔄 It defines two generic classes, `TransformsInto` and `TransformsFrom`, which handle the conversion between different representations of IO types in the config.
🔀 `TransformsInto` has a method `transform_from_config` that transforms a config variable into the type used in the action.
❌ The `transform_from_config` method is currently not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`.
⚙️ `TransformsFrom` has a method `_get_config_type` that should return the type of the config variable, but it is also not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`.
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for converting between different representations of IO types in the config.
🔧 It is likely that this file is meant to be extended or used as a base class for specific implementations of IO type transformations.
🔍 This file may be part of a larger codebase or project that deals with configuration and action variables.
📚 It is important to ensure that the `transform_from_config` and `_get_config_type` methods are implemented correctly in subclasses or derived classes.
🔧 Overall, this file provides an abstraction for handling the transformation of IO types between the config and action variables.


### [`value_declarations.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/tree/main/./autopr/models/config/value_declarations.py/)

📄 This file defines a set of classes and declarations related to variables and parameters.
📝 These classes provide functionality for rendering and evaluating values within a given context.
⚙️ The file also includes a dictionary of commonly used modules and objects for evaluation.
🔤 The Variable class is the base class for all variable declarations.
📝 The TemplateDeclaration class represents a string that can be rendered within a context.
🔀 The VarDeclaration class represents a string that references a variable or nested variable in the context.
🔢 The ConstDeclaration class represents a constant value.
🐍 The LambdaDeclaration class represents a Python expression that can be evaluated within a context.
🔑 The ParamDeclaration class represents a string that references a parameter passed in trigger invocation.
🔀 The ValueDeclaration type is a union of different types of variable declarations.
