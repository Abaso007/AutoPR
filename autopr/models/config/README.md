## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files that define and configure actions, workflows, and context models for an automation system. It includes base model classes with different configuration settings, code for building workflow models and trigger configurations, code for transforming between config and action variables, and classes and declarations related to variables and parameters. The files are organized and utilize the Pydantic library for data validation and modeling, providing a foundation for building a flexible and extensible automation system.


### [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/c479ccb445eededecd497d0d91bc86a1df0f2300/./autopr/models/config/__init__.py)

This file is empty.  


### [`common.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/c479ccb445eededecd497d0d91bc86a1df0f2300/./autopr/models/config/common.py)

📄 This file contains Python code  
🔒 It defines a class named "StrictModel" which inherits from pydantic.BaseModel  
🔒 The "StrictModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for forbidding extra fields in the model  
🔒 The "StrictModel" class also has a configuration setting "smart_union" which enables smart coercion of values in union types  
🔒 There is another class named "ExtraModel" which also inherits from pydantic.BaseModel  
🔒 The "ExtraModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for allowing extra fields in the model  
💡 The purpose of this file is to define two base model classes with different configuration settings for handling extra fields  


### [`elements.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/c479ccb445eededecd497d0d91bc86a1df0f2300/./autopr/models/config/elements.py)

📝 This file contains code for defining and configuring actions, workflows, and context models.  
🧩 It includes classes for executing actions on context variables and conditional execution.  
🔄 Workflows can be defined with a sequence of steps and input/output specifications.  
🔧 There are models for specifying inputs and outputs of executables.  
📌 The file also includes helper functions for building action models dynamically.  
📚 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for defining and executing automated processes.  
🧰 It utilizes the Pydantic library for data validation and modeling.  
🔧 The code is organized into classes and models to promote modularity and reusability.  
📋 The file can be used as a template for creating and configuring automated workflows.  
🚀 Overall, this file serves as a foundation for building a flexible and extensible automation system.  


### [`entrypoints.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/c479ccb445eededecd497d0d91bc86a1df0f2300/./autopr/models/config/entrypoints.py)

📄 This file contains code for building workflow models and trigger configurations in an automation system.   
🔧 It dynamically builds workflow models based on the currently defined workflows.  
🔄 The `build_workflows()` function creates workflow models for each defined workflow, including parameters and inputs/outputs.  
🎯 The purpose is to provide type hints and autocompletion in the jsonschema for better development experience.  
🔀 The file also defines trigger models such as label triggers, comment triggers, push triggers, and cron triggers.  
🔗 The trigger models inherit from a base `TriggerModel` class and provide a method to get the context for an event.  
📝 The file also includes the definition of a strict workflow configuration and top-level trigger configuration.  
📚 The `trigger_schema.json`, `workflow_schema.json`, and `strict_workflow_schema.json` files are generated from the schemas of the trigger and workflow configurations.  
📝 The purpose of these schemas is to provide a standardized representation of the trigger and workflow configurations.  


### [`transform.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/c479ccb445eededecd497d0d91bc86a1df0f2300/./autopr/models/config/transform.py)

📄 This file contains code for transforming between config and action variables.  
🔄 It defines two generic classes, `TransformsInto` and `TransformsFrom`, which handle the conversion between different representations of IO types in the config.  
🔀 `TransformsInto` has a method `transform_from_config` that transforms a config variable into the type used in the action.  
❌ The `transform_from_config` method is currently not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`.  
⚙️ `TransformsFrom` has a method `_get_config_type` that should return the type of the config variable, but it is also not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`.  
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for converting between different representations of IO types in the config.  
🔧 It is likely that this file is meant to be extended or used as a base class for specific implementations of IO type transformations.  
🔍 This file may be part of a larger codebase or project that deals with configuration and action variables.  
📚 It is important to ensure that the `transform_from_config` and `_get_config_type` methods are implemented correctly in subclasses or derived classes.  
🔧 Overall, this file provides an abstraction for handling the transformation of IO types between the config and action variables.  


### [`value_declarations.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/c479ccb445eededecd497d0d91bc86a1df0f2300/./autopr/models/config/value_declarations.py)

📄 This file defines a set of classes and declarations related to variables and parameters.  
📝 These classes provide functionality for rendering and evaluating values within a given context.  
⚙️ The file also includes a dictionary of commonly used modules and objects for evaluation.  
🔤 The Variable class is the base class for all variable declarations.  
📝 The TemplateDeclaration class represents a string that can be rendered within a context.  
🔀 The VarDeclaration class represents a string that references a variable or nested variable in the context.  
🔢 The ConstDeclaration class represents a constant value.  
🐍 The LambdaDeclaration class represents a Python expression that can be evaluated within a context.  
🔑 The ParamDeclaration class represents a string that references a parameter passed in trigger invocation.  
🔀 The ValueDeclaration type is a union of different types of variable declarations.
