## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains Python code files related to workflow execution and context manipulation. The files define base model classes for handling extra fields, build workflow models and trigger configurations, transform between config and action variables, and declare variables and parameters for rendering and evaluating values within a context. The folder provides a framework for building and managing workflows in an automation system.


### `__init__.py`

📄 This file appears to be empty.     
🤔 It is unclear what the purpose of this file is.     
🚫 No content or code is present in this file.     
🔍 There is no information to summarize.     
💡 Please check if any content is missing or if there was an error in the file.     
📝 This file may need to be filled with code or information.     
❌ Nothing to summarize at this time.     
📑 The purpose of this file is not apparent.

### `common.py`

📄 This file contains Python code
🔒 It defines a class named "StrictModel" which inherits from pydantic.BaseModel
🔒 The "StrictModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for forbidding extra fields in the model
🔒 The "StrictModel" class also has a configuration setting "smart_union" which enables smart coercion of values in union types
🔒 There is another class named "ExtraModel" which also inherits from pydantic.BaseModel
🔒 The "ExtraModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for allowing extra fields in the model
💡 The purpose of this file is to define two base model classes with different configuration settings for handling extra fields


### `elements.py`

📜 This file contains Python code for defining models and actions related to workflow execution and context manipulation.


### `entrypoints.py`

📝 This file contains Python code for building workflow models and triggers using the Pydantic library.
🔧 The purpose of the file is to dynamically create workflow models and trigger configurations based on the defined workflows and events.
🔗 The file imports various modules and types from external libraries and other files.
🔨 It defines functions to build workflow models and retrieve executable IDs.
📜 It also defines classes for different types of triggers, such as label, comment, and push triggers.
🔀 The file includes parsing entrypoints for workflow definitions and trigger configurations.
📋 It provides JSON schema representations of the trigger and workflow configurations.
💡 The main block of the file writes the JSON schemas to separate files.
🧩 The file can be used as a module to generate workflow models and trigger configurations for an automation system.
🔍 The code can be further explored to understand the specific implementation details and logic.


### `transform.py`

📄 This file contains code for transforming between config and action variables.
🔄 It defines two generic classes, `TransformsInto` and `TransformsFrom`, which handle the conversion between different representations of IO types in the config.
🔀 `TransformsInto` has a method `transform_from_config` that transforms a config variable into the type used in the action.
❌ The `transform_from_config` method is currently not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`.
⚙️ `TransformsFrom` has a method `_get_config_type` that should return the type of the config variable, but it is also not implemented and raises a `NotImplementedError`.
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for converting between different representations of IO types in the config.
🔧 It is likely that this file is meant to be extended or used as a base class for specific implementations of IO type transformations.
🔍 This file may be part of a larger codebase or project that deals with configuration and action variables.
📚 It is important to ensure that the `transform_from_config` and `_get_config_type` methods are implemented correctly in subclasses or derived classes.
🔧 Overall, this file provides an abstraction for handling the transformation of IO types between the config and action variables.


### `value_declarations.py`

📄 This file defines a set of classes and declarations related to variables and parameters.
📝 These classes provide functionality for rendering and evaluating values within a given context.
⚙️ The file also includes a dictionary of commonly used modules and objects for evaluation.
🔤 The Variable class is the base class for all variable declarations.
📝 The TemplateDeclaration class represents a string that can be rendered within a context.
🔀 The VarDeclaration class represents a string that references a variable or nested variable in the context.
🔢 The ConstDeclaration class represents a constant value.
🐍 The LambdaDeclaration class represents a Python expression that can be evaluated within a context.
🔑 The ParamDeclaration class represents a string that references a parameter passed in trigger invocation.
🔀 The ValueDeclaration type is a union of different types of variable declarations.
