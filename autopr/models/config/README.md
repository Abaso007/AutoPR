## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains several Python files that serve different purposes in a larger codebase related to automation and configuration management. The "common.py" file defines two base model classes for handling extra fields in models. The "elements.py" file provides models and classes for executing actions and workflows. The "entrypoints.py" file is related to building workflow definitions and triggers. The "transform.py" file provides a framework for handling config and action variable transformations. The "value_declarations.py" file manages and renders variables and parameters in a Python program.


### [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/e36635316560c218f91e02e1d071753bb4162785/./autopr/models/config/__init__.py)

This file is empty.  


### [`common.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/e36635316560c218f91e02e1d071753bb4162785/./autopr/models/config/common.py)

📄 This file contains Python code  
🔒 It defines a class named "StrictModel" which inherits from pydantic.BaseModel  
🔒 The "StrictModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for forbidding extra fields in the model  
🔒 The "StrictModel" class also has a configuration setting "smart_union" which enables smart coercion of values in union types  
🔒 There is another class named "ExtraModel" which also inherits from pydantic.BaseModel  
🔒 The "ExtraModel" class has a nested class named "Config" with a configuration setting for allowing extra fields in the model  
💡 The purpose of this file is to define two base model classes with different configuration settings for handling extra fields  


### [`elements.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/e36635316560c218f91e02e1d071753bb4162785/./autopr/models/config/elements.py)

📄 This file contains a Python script that defines various models and classes related to executing actions and workflows.  
🔧 It includes classes for context actions, conditionals, and set variables.  
🔀 There are also models for executable actions, iterable actions, and workflow invocations.  
🚀 The file provides a way to dynamically build action models based on currently defined actions.  
📝 Overall, it serves as a foundation for defining and executing actions and workflows in a flexible manner.  


### [`entrypoints.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/e36635316560c218f91e02e1d071753bb4162785/./autopr/models/config/entrypoints.py)

📝 This file contains code related to building workflow definitions and triggers for an automated process.  
🔧 It imports various modules and defines several classes and functions.  
🔀 The `build_workflows` function dynamically builds workflow models based on currently defined workflows.  
📋 The `get_params` function retrieves parameters from an executable.  
🚀 The `get_all_executable_ids` function retrieves all executable IDs.  
🔀 The file also defines trigger models such as `LabelTrigger`, `CommentTrigger`, `PushTrigger`, and `CronTrigger`.  
📝 The `StrictWorkflowDefinition` class represents a strict workflow definition.  
🔀 The `TopLevelTriggerConfig` class represents the top-level trigger configuration.  
📝 The file includes code to generate JSON schemas for trigger configuration, workflow configuration, and strict workflow configuration.  
📝 The generated JSON schemas are saved to separate files if the script is executed directly.  


### [`transform.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/e36635316560c218f91e02e1d071753bb4162785/./autopr/models/config/transform.py)

📄 This file defines two generic classes for transforming between config and action variables.    
🔀 The `TransformsInto` class is used to transform a config variable into the type used in the action.    
🔀 The `TransformsFrom` class is used to define the config type for an IO type.    
❗ The file is incomplete and contains placeholder implementations.    
💡 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for handling config and action variable transformations.  


### [`value_declarations.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/e36635316560c218f91e02e1d071753bb4162785/./autopr/models/config/value_declarations.py)

📄 This file defines classes and declarations related to variables and parameters in a Python context.  
🔧 It provides different types of declarations such as template, variable, constant, and lambda.  
📝 Declarations can be rendered within a context to obtain their values.  
🔀 The context can include built-in modules and custom parameters.  
🎯 The purpose of this file is to provide a framework for managing and rendering variables and parameters in a Python program.  
🔍 It allows for flexible handling of different types of values and expressions.  
📚 The file includes type annotations and imports necessary modules.  
📖 It is part of a larger codebase related to automation and configuration management.  
🛠️ The classes and declarations defined in this file can be used to create and manipulate variables in different contexts.  
🔎 This file serves as a reference for understanding the structure and functionality of the variable management system.
