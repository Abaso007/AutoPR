## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains Python code files related to a project. The files define data models for messages, threads, issues, and pull requests, as well as handle workflow execution and context manipulation. There are also models for different types of events that can trigger automated actions. Overall, this folder provides a foundation for working with messages, threads, issues, and pull requests, as well as managing workflows in an automation system.

### `artifacts.py`

📄 This file contains Python code for defining data models related to messages, threads, issues, and pull requests.
📝 The purpose of the code is to provide a structured way to represent and manipulate these data types.
💬 The `Message` class represents a single message with a body and an author.
🧵 The `Thread` class represents a collection of messages, forming a conversation thread.
🔢 The `Issue` class extends the `Thread` class and adds additional properties like number, title, author, and timestamp.
🔀 The `PullRequest` class extends the `Issue` class and adds properties specific to pull requests, like base branch and head branch.
🔒 The `CodeComment` class is commented out, but it represents comments related to code changes in a pull request.
📝 The `DiffStr` type alias is defined for representing diff strings.
🗒️ Overall, this file provides a foundation for working with messages, threads, issues, and pull requests in Python.


### `config`

This folder contains Python code files related to workflow execution and context manipulation. The files define base model classes for handling extra fields, build workflow models and trigger configurations, transform between config and action variables, and declare variables and parameters for rendering and evaluating values within a context. The folder provides a framework for building and managing workflows in an automation system.


### `events.py`

📄 This file defines a set of Pydantic models for different types of events that can trigger AutoPR to run. 
🔀 The `Event` model is the base model for all events and has an `event_type` attribute. 
🔖 The `LabelEvent` model represents an event triggered when a label is added to an issue or pull request. 
💬 The `CommentEvent` model represents an event triggered when a comment is added to an issue or pull request. 
🚀 The `PushEvent` model represents an event triggered when a push is made to a branch. 
🗂️ There is a commented-out `CodeReviewEvent` model that represents an event triggered when a comment is added to a code review. 
🔀 The `EventUnion` type is a Union of the different event models. 
❌ The file currently does not contain any implementation details or logic. 
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a structured way to define and handle different types of events in the AutoPR system.


### `executable.py`

📝 This file contains a Python module that defines various types and classes related to context variables, templates, and executable actions.
