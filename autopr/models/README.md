## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains Python code and configuration files related to a larger codebase. The "artifacts.py" file defines data models for messages, threads, issues, and pull requests. The "config/" folder contains files for automation and configuration management. The "events.py" file defines classes for different types of events. The "executable.py" file provides reusable types and classes for managing context and executing actions in a Python project.


### [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/03521e243e018b61236da467e94d47d89783b5e6/./autopr/models/__init__.py)

This file is empty.  


### [`artifacts.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/03521e243e018b61236da467e94d47d89783b5e6/./autopr/models/artifacts.py)

📄 This file contains Python code for defining data models related to messages, threads, issues, and pull requests.  
📝 The purpose of the code is to provide a structured way to represent and manipulate these data types.  
💬 The `Message` class represents a single message with a body and an author.  
🧵 The `Thread` class represents a collection of messages, forming a conversation thread.  
🔢 The `Issue` class extends the `Thread` class and adds additional properties like number, title, author, and timestamp.  
🔀 The `PullRequest` class extends the `Issue` class and adds properties specific to pull requests, like base branch and head branch.  
🔒 The `CodeComment` class is commented out, but it represents comments related to code changes in a pull request.  
📝 The `DiffStr` type alias is defined for representing diff strings.  
🗒️ Overall, this file provides a foundation for working with messages, threads, issues, and pull requests in Python.  


### [`config/`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/03521e243e018b61236da467e94d47d89783b5e6/./autopr/models/config)

This folder contains several Python files that serve different purposes in a larger codebase related to automation and configuration management. The "common.py" file defines two base model classes for handling extra fields in models. The "elements.py" file provides models and classes for executing actions and workflows. The "entrypoints.py" file is related to building workflow definitions and triggers. The "transform.py" file provides a framework for handling config and action variable transformations. The "value_declarations.py" file manages and renders variables and parameters in a Python program.  


### [`events.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/03521e243e018b61236da467e94d47d89783b5e6/./autopr/models/events.py)

📋 This file defines several classes related to events in AutoPR.    
🔧 It includes the base `Event` class and subclasses for different types of events.    
🔖 The `LabelEvent` class represents an event triggered when a label is added.    
💬 The `CommentEvent` class represents an event triggered when a comment is added.    
📝 The `PushEvent` class represents an event triggered when a push is made to a branch.    
⏰ The `CronEvent` class represents an event triggered by a cron job.    
🔒 There is a commented-out `CodeReviewEvent` class that is not currently used.    
🔀 The `EventUnion` type is an alias for a union of all the event subclasses.    
📄 This file is part of the `autopr.models.events` module.  


### [`executable.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/03521e243e018b61236da467e94d47d89783b5e6/./autopr/models/executable.py)

📝 This file defines various types and classes used for context management and template rendering in a Python project.  
📝 It imports modules such as `json`, `jinja2`, and `pydantic`.  
📝 It defines type aliases for different string representations used in the project, such as `LambdaString`, `ContextVarName`, `ContextVarPath`, `TemplateString`, etc.  
📝 It defines a `ContextDict` class that extends the built-in `dict` class and provides additional methods for accessing values from the context and rendering templates.  
📝 It defines a `ControlWords` type alias that represents a literal tuple of control words like "quit", "return", and "continue".  
📝 It defines an `ExecutableId` class that extends the built-in `str` class and adds validation to prevent reserved keywords from being used as executable IDs.  
📝 It defines `ExecutableForwardRef` and `StrictExecutableForwardRef` types that are used as forward references for executable IDs in different contexts.  
📝 It defines `Executable` and `StrictExecutable` types that represent executable IDs or lists of executable IDs.  
📝 The file includes some TODOs and comments indicating areas for improvement or future work.  
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a set of reusable types and classes for managing context and executing actions in a Python project.
