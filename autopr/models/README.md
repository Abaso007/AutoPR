## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files related to a codebase for automation and configuration management. The "artifacts.py" file defines Pydantic models for messages, threads, issues, and pull requests. The "config/" folder contains Python files for handling extra fields in models, executing actions and workflows, building workflow definitions and triggers, handling config and action variable transformations, and managing and rendering variables and parameters. The "events.py" file defines classes for different types of events in AutoPR. The "executable.py" file provides types and classes for context management and template rendering in a Python project.


### [`__init__.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/0aabc10f58cc0543244c461caaef386a82b74854/./autopr/models/__init__.py)

This file is empty.  


### [`artifacts.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/0aabc10f58cc0543244c461caaef386a82b74854/./autopr/models/artifacts.py)

📄 This file defines several Pydantic models for representing messages, threads, issues, and pull requests.   
📝 The `Message` model represents a message with a body and an author.   
🧵 The `Thread` model represents a collection of messages.   
🔧 The `Issue` model represents an issue with additional properties like openness, number, title, author, and timestamp.   
🔀 The `PullRequest` model represents a pull request with additional properties like base branch, head branch, and base commit SHA.   
🔒 The `CodeComment` model is currently commented out, but it would represent a code comment with properties like commit SHA, filepath, status, and line numbers.   
📝 The `DiffStr` type alias is defined as a string.   
📝 The file contains import statements for necessary modules.  


### [`config/`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/0aabc10f58cc0543244c461caaef386a82b74854/./autopr/models/config)

This folder contains several Python files that serve different purposes in a larger codebase related to automation and configuration management. The "common.py" file defines two base model classes for handling extra fields in models. The "elements.py" file provides models and classes for executing actions and workflows. The "entrypoints.py" file is related to building workflow definitions and triggers. The "transform.py" file provides a framework for handling config and action variable transformations. The "value_declarations.py" file manages and renders variables and parameters in a Python program.  


### [`events.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/0aabc10f58cc0543244c461caaef386a82b74854/./autopr/models/events.py)

📋 This file defines several classes related to events in AutoPR.    
🔧 It includes the base `Event` class and subclasses for different types of events.    
🔖 The `LabelEvent` class represents an event triggered when a label is added.    
💬 The `CommentEvent` class represents an event triggered when a comment is added.    
📝 The `PushEvent` class represents an event triggered when a push is made to a branch.    
⏰ The `CronEvent` class represents an event triggered by a cron job.    
🔒 There is a commented-out `CodeReviewEvent` class that is not currently used.    
🔀 The `EventUnion` type is an alias for a union of all the event subclasses.    
📄 This file is part of the `autopr.models.events` module.  


### [`executable.py`](https://github.com/raphael-francis/AutoPR-internal/blob/0aabc10f58cc0543244c461caaef386a82b74854/./autopr/models/executable.py)

📝 This file defines various types and classes used for context management and template rendering in a Python project.  
📝 It imports modules such as `json`, `jinja2`, and `pydantic`.  
📝 It defines type aliases for different string representations used in the project, such as `LambdaString`, `ContextVarName`, `ContextVarPath`, `TemplateString`, etc.  
📝 It defines a `ContextDict` class that extends the built-in `dict` class and provides additional methods for accessing values from the context and rendering templates.  
📝 It defines a `ControlWords` type alias that represents a literal tuple of control words like "quit", "return", and "continue".  
📝 It defines an `ExecutableId` class that extends the built-in `str` class and adds validation to prevent reserved keywords from being used as executable IDs.  
📝 It defines `ExecutableForwardRef` and `StrictExecutableForwardRef` types that are used as forward references for executable IDs in different contexts.  
📝 It defines `Executable` and `StrictExecutable` types that represent executable IDs or lists of executable IDs.  
📝 The file includes some TODOs and comments indicating areas for improvement or future work.  
📝 The purpose of this file is to provide a set of reusable types and classes for managing context and executing actions in a Python project.
