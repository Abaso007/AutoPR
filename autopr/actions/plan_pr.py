These are notes we took while looking at the repo:

When you're done, send me the pull request title, body, and a list of commits, each coupled with which files we should be looking at to write the commit's code.
Ensure you specify the files relevant to the commit, especially if the commit is a refactor.
Folders are created automatically; do not make them in their own commit."""
