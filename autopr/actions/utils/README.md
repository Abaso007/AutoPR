## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains two Python files. The `__init__.py` file appears to be empty. The `prompt_context.py` file contains code that implements a prompt context model for auto PR generation. It defines classes and functions related to defining and transforming prompt contexts. The code seems to be part of a larger project and includes imports of modules like `pydantic`, `tiktoken`, and `jinja2` for type checking, encoding, and template rendering.


### `__init__.py`

### `prompt_context.py`

📄 This file contains Python code implementing a prompt context model for auto PR generation.
🔧 It includes classes and functions related to defining and transforming prompt contexts.
📝 The `PromptContext` class represents a dictionary mapping headings to context variable values.
🔢 The `PromptContextEntry` class represents a single entry in the context heading dictionary.
🧩 The file also defines different types of declarations for prompt context in config.
🔀 The `PromptContextInConfig` class transforms prompt context declarations from config into `PromptContext` instances.
🔍 The `get_string_token_length` function calculates the token length of a string based on a given model.
📝 The file includes docstrings and comments explaining the purpose and usage of the code.
🧪 The code seems to be part of a larger project related to auto PR generation and configuration.
🔧 It imports modules like `pydantic`, `tiktoken`, and `jinja2` for type checking, encoding, and template rendering.
