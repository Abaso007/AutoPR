## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains two files. The `__init__.py` file appears to be empty and its purpose is unclear. The `prompt_context.py` file contains Python code that implements a prompt context model for auto PR generation. It defines classes and functions related to defining and transforming prompt contexts, and includes docstrings and comments explaining the purpose and usage of the code.
