.autopr:
---
This folder appears to be focused on configuring and controlling automated actions within a project. The "triggers.yml" file contains definitions for triggers that activate specific actions based on branch names. It also includes parameters related to generating summaries for file purposes and handling scenarios involving empty files. Overall, this folder facilitates the setup of automated workflows and responses tied to specific branches and file content characteristics within the project.

__init__.py:
---
This file is empty.

example_repo_3_subfolder:
---
This folder seems to revolve around testing and verifying the functionality of the "crawl_folder" action. The "crawl_folder.py" file contains a series of steps for this purpose, including module imports, test definition and execution, parameterization of test cases using `pytest.mark.parametrize`, and mocking of the OpenAI API using the `mock_openai` function. The primary objective of the folder is to rigorously test the "crawl_folder" action by comparing its actual outputs against expected outcomes, particularly concerning the list of files. This testing process ensures the correctness and reliability of the action's behavior within the project.

first_mock_file.py:
---
The purpose of this file is to define a Python class called "WriteIntoFile" that performs the following actions:
- It takes input parameters such as the filepath, content, and whether to append or replace the file content.
- It writes the specified content into the specified file, either by appending it to the end or replacing the entire file content.
- It returns an output indicating whether the file was written to successfully.
- It can be executed as a standalone script to manually run the "WriteIntoFile" action with predefined input parameters and remove the created file afterwards.
---

second_mock_file.py:
---
The purpose of this file is to define a mock environment for OpenAI's interaction model. It sets up a dictionary called `prompt_to_response` that links prompts to corresponding responses. These prompts and responses are read from files in specific subdirectories within a "data/mock_prompts" directory. The code mimics OpenAI's behavior by mapping prompts to predefined responses. This mock environment allows for testing and simulating interactions with the OpenAI model without making actual API calls. It's primarily used for local development and testing to ensure the application's behavior aligns with the expected responses from the model.
