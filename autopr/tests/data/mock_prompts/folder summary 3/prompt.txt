.autopr:
---
This folder appears to contain a configuration file named "triggers.yml" that defines triggers for automated actions related to branch names. The triggers seem to be designed to initiate specific actions or processes based on the names of branches within a version control system, such as Git. The content within the YAML file suggests that these triggers may be used for generating summaries of file purposes and handling empty files. Overall, the folder appears to be dedicated to configuring and managing automated processes and actions within a software development or version control context.

example_repo_2_subfolder:
---
- The folder contains a Python script named "crawl_folder.py".
- The script is used to perform a specific action called "crawl_folder".
- The script imports necessary modules and libraries to execute the action.
- It defines and runs tests for the "crawl_folder" action using the pytest framework.
- The script uses the `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to specify different test inputs and expected outputs.
- It mocks the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` function using the `mock_openai` function.
- The script asserts the expected outputs of the action and compares them with the provided expected list of files.

first_mock_file.py:
---
The purpose of this file is to define a Python class called "WriteIntoFile" that performs the following actions:
- It takes input parameters such as the filepath, content, and whether to append or replace the file content.
- It writes the specified content into the specified file, either by appending it to the end or replacing the entire file content.
- It returns an output indicating whether the file was written to successfully.
- It can be executed as a standalone script to manually run the "WriteIntoFile" action with predefined input parameters and remove the created file afterwards.

second_mock_file.py:
---
The purpose of this file is to define a class called "SerializableJsonSchemaObject" with various properties and methods. Here are the main purposes of this file:

1. Define a data model class: The file defines a class called "SerializableJsonSchemaObject" which serves as a data model for representing JSON schema objects.

2. Validation and transformation methods: The class includes several methods for validating and transforming the data within the JSON schema object. For example, there are methods for validating exclusive maximum and minimum values, validating references, and validating items.

3. Property access and manipulation: The class includes properties for accessing and manipulating various properties of the JSON schema object, such as "is_object", "is_array", "ref_object_name", "has_default", "has_constraint", and "ref_type".

4. Configuration and customization: The class includes a nested "Config" class that allows for configuration and customization of the behavior of the data model class. For example, it allows for specifying arbitrary types, ignored types, and smart casts.

5. Additional utility methods: The class includes additional utility methods such as "__init__" for initializing the object, "get_fields" for retrieving the fields of the object, and "validate_exclusive_maximum_and_exclusive_minimum" for validating exclusive maximum and minimum values.
