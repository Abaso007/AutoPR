The purpose of this file is to define a mock environment for OpenAI's interaction model. It sets up a dictionary called `prompt_to_response` that links prompts to corresponding responses. These prompts and responses are read from files in specific subdirectories within a "data/mock_prompts" directory. The code mimics OpenAI's behavior by mapping prompts to predefined responses. This mock environment allows for testing and simulating interactions with the OpenAI model without making actual API calls. It's primarily used for local development and testing to ensure the application's behavior aligns with the expected responses from the model.
