# ðŸŒŠ Workflow catalogue

See here for a list of default workflows that you can use in your own repositories.

## `summarize_pr`

The `summarize_pr` workflow summarizes a pull request by:
- getting the diff of the pull request,
- generating a summary of the diff,
- posting a comment with the summary.

You can invoke it by using the following trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: label
    label_substring: summarize
    on_pull_request: true
    workflow: summarize_pr
```

And adding a `summarize` label to a pull request.

## `generate_readme_summaries`

The `generate_readme_summaries` workflow:
- crawls the repository's folders,
- summarizes each file and folder,
- generates a `README.md` file with the summaries in each folder.

The following parameters are available:
- `FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT`: the prompt to use when asking for a summary of a file.
- `FILE_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS`: the instructions to use when asking for a summary of a file.
- `FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT`: the prompt to use when asking for a summary of a folder.
- `FOLDER_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS`: the instructions to use when asking for a summary of a folder.
- `IGNORE_FILES`: a list of files to ignore when crawling the repository.
- `EMPTY_FILE_SUMMARY`: the summary to use when a file is empty.

You can invoke it by using the following trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - branch_name: main
    run:
      workflow: generate_readme_summaries
      parameters:
        FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write an executive summary of this file, intended for someone seeing it for the first time. Write 3-6 bullet points, prefixed with emojis."
        FILE_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS: "Respond in 3-6 bullet points, using plenty of emojis."
        FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write an executive summary of this folder, intended for someone seeing it for the first time. Respond in 3-5 sentences."
        FOLDER_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS: "Respond in simple sentences, using plenty of emojis."
        IGNORE_FILES:
          - docs
        EMPTY_FILE_SUMMARY: "This file is empty."
```

The above trigger will run the workflow whenever the `main` branch is updated.

## `list_todos`

The `list_todos` manages code annotations by: 
- Scanning the repository for all occurrences of TODOs and FIXMEs.
- Leveraging LLM to obtain suggestions for solving them and assesing their difficulty.
- posting them on the platform as an issue.

The following parameters are available:
- `ISSUE_LABEL_CHOICES`: the choices to use when asking for the difficulty of a task.
- `ISSUE_LABEL_PROMPT`: the prompt to use when asking for the difficulty of a task.
- `ISSUE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT`: the prompt to use when asking for a resolution of a TODO.
- `ISSUE_DESCRIPTION_INSTRUCTIONS`: the instructions to use when asking for a resolution of a TODO.

You can invoke it by using the following trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - branch_name: main
    run:
      workflow: publish_todo_issues
      parameters:
        ISSUE_LABEL_CHOICES:
          - "easy"
          - "medium"
          - "hard"
        ISSUE_LABEL_PROMPT: |
          How hard is this task?
        ISSUE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT: |
          What tips can you give to someone that's resolving this TODO?
        ISSUE_DESCRIPTION_INSTRUCTIONS: |
          Respond in 1-3 sentences.
```

## `api_git_history`

The `api_git_history` workflow creates a history of selected API GET requests payloads by:
- fetching an API GET request,
- saving the response payload to a file,
- committing the file to the repository.

The following inputs are available:
- `endpoint_url`: the URL of the API endpoint to fetch
- `headers`: the headers to use when fetching the API endpoint
- `filepath`: the path of the file to save the response payload to

You can invoke it by using [Cron Trigger](/reference/triggers#-properties-of-different-triggers):

```yaml
triggers:
  - cron_schedule: "0 0 * * *"
    run: 
      workflow: api_git_history
      inputs: 
        endpoint_url: 
          const: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"
        headers: 
          const: {"Content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"}
        filepath:
          const: "todos.json"
```
