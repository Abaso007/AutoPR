# üèÅ Triggers

Triggers are the sensors of your repository. They monitor for specific events, and once an event
occurs, they initiate a workflow. Let's deep dive into how to write triggers.

**Important**: Before you begin writing a trigger, [set up validation in your editor](../tutorials/setting-up-yaml-schema) for ease of writing.

Triggers are located in your `.autopr` configuration directory, as the `.autopr/triggers.yaml` file.
Alternatively, you can also define triggers in the `.autopr/triggers/*.yaml` folder.

## üßê Properties of different triggers

Each trigger has the `run` property, which specified the action or workflow that is activated when the trigger condition is met.
`run` must either be an invocation of a workflow/action, or match the name of one.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="nametrigger" label="Invocation Trigger">

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "label"
    label_substring: "summarize"
    on_issue: false
    on_pull_request: true
    run:
      workflow: "summarize_pr"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pushtrigger" label="Name Trigger">

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "label"
    label_substring: "summarize"
    on_issue: false
    on_pull_request: true
    run: "summarize_pr"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Use the "Invocation Trigger" syntax if you'd like to specify a workflow's inputs or parameters.

A workflow's `parameters` property, is optionally used to override global variables in the workflow.
For example, the `parameters` property can be used to define the `FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT` variable, which is used in the
[generate_readme_summaries](../workflow-catalogue#generate_readme_summaries) workflow.

Additionally, each respective trigger has its own unique properties:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="labeltrigger" label="Label Trigger">

Activates when a label is added to an issue or a pull request.
- **`label_substring`**: Trigger when a label contains this substring.
- **`on_issue`**: Whether the trigger should respond to issues.
- **`on_pull_request`**: Whether the trigger should respond to pull requests.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "label"
    label_substring: "summarize"
    on_issue: false
    on_pull_request: true
    run: "summarize_pr"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pushtrigger" label="Push Trigger">

Activates when a push is made to the specified branch.
- **`branch_name`**: Pinpoints the branch that the trigger observes for changes.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "push"
    branch_name: "main"
    run:
      workflow: "generate_readme_summaries"
      parameters:
        FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write a summary of this file for first-timers. Use 3-6 bullet points with emojis."
        FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Give a quick summary of this folder in 3-5 sentences."
        IGNORE_FILES:
          - docs
          - .github
          - .autopr
          - tests
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="crontrigger" label="Cron Trigger">

Activates on a schedule according to a cron expression. Feel free to use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to help you write cron expressions.
- **`cron_schedule`**: The cron expression that specifies the schedule (e.g. `0 0 * * *` for daily at midnight).

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: "cron"
    cron_schedule: "0 0 * * *"
    run: "generate_readme_summaries"
```

When using a cron trigger, make sure to specify the same schedule in your `.github/workflows/autopr.yml` file:

```yaml
name: autopr
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## üìÑ Example

Below is an example of a `.autopr/triggers.yaml` file, that summarizes pull requests when the `summarize` label is added,
and generates README summaries when a push is made to the `main` branch.

```yaml
triggers:
  - type: label
    label_substring: summarize
    on_issue: false
    on_pull_request: true
    run: summarize_pr
  - type: push
    branch_name: main
    run:
      workflow: generate_readme_summaries
      parameters:
        FILE_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Write a summary of this file for first-timers. Use 3-6 bullet points with emojis."
        FOLDER_SUMMARY_PROMPT: "Give a quick summary of this folder in 3-5 sentences."
        IGNORE_FILES:
          - docs
          - .github
          - .autopr
          - tests
```
