## 🏁 Triggers

To configure AutoPR, write **triggers** in **YAML**.

For more information, see [the Triggers reference](reference/triggers).

## 🕳️ Under the Hood

AutoPR workflows are composed of actions, and they're triggered by events.

### 💧 Actions

**Actions** are written in **python**; they define small reusable bits of orthogonal functionality.

For more information, see [Writing an Action](tutorials/writing-an-action).

### 🌊 Workflows

**Workflows** are written in **YAML**; they provide a simple configurable language for orchestrating actions.

For more information, see [Writing a Workflow](tutorials/writing-a-workflow).
